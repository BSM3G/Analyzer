replaced atan with atan2 which works in all quadrants and can handle 90* and -90* angles
This means that the graphs dphiMHT are different because of this

eta and pt cuts on genTaus are used in the cutting process, but aren't in the histograms
in the old code.  Changed this, but leads to different results on different eta/pt cuts

smear in old code is wrong: smear uses the last particle and returns that, not the
one that actual matches to the deltaR.  This means different results will be found
in old and new code (changes in my verision and verified though)

hps stuff difference not found in files I've tried so far.  will investigate
